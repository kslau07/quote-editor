<%# app/views/quotes/create.turbo_stream.erb %>

<!--
	In this view, we instruct Turbo to do two things:

	1. The first line tells Turbo to prepend to the Turbo Frame with id quotes the app/views/quotes/_quote.html.erb partial. As we can see, it's straightforward to pass a partial and locals to the turbo_stream helper.
		i. turbo_frame_tag id 'quotes' is located in index.html.erb
	2. The second line tells Turbo to update the Turbo Frame with id new_quote with empty content.
-->

<!-- 

	# Very long-hand way to write
	<%= turbo_stream.prepend 'quotes', partial: 'quotes/quote', locals: { quote: @quote } %>

	# Alternative to above (instead of 1 long line)
	<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes" do %>
		<%= render partial: "quotes/quote", locals: { quote: @quote } %>
	<% end %>

	# Even shorter
	<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes" do %>
		<%= render @quote %>
	<% end %>

	# Shortest!
	<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes", @quote %>
-->

<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes", @quote %>

<!-- Update the frame with dom_id(Quote.new) with blank content ('') -->
<!-- If we add text to the quotes, it shows up in frame -->
<%= turbo_stream.update Quote.new, '' %>
